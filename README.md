# Trendster

This Ruby gem scrapes the events page from the Cuyahoga County Public Library's website using Nokogiri and delivers the events' name, description, location, and audience right to your command line.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trendster'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trendster

## Usage

Follow the directions on the command line interface. A list of Cuyahoga County Public Library events will be given. Enter the number of the event you'd like more details on. You can type 'list' to see the list of events again or type 'exit' to exit the application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
